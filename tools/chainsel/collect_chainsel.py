"""
Collect chainsel results into the table.

Scans <run_dir>/<table>/chainsel/ for the per-design TSV files written by
chainsel.sh, and merges the extraction back into the table as <prefix>_status /
<prefix>_path (the extracted structure -- the whole point of the tool, and what a
downstream comparison consumes) plus one <prefix>_<field> column per field:

    n_chains    number of OUTPUT chains actually written. With --merge-groups
                that is the number of GROUPS, so it is smaller than the number of
                source chains ('A+C:A,B+D:B' on a 4-chain file writes 2).
    n_res       residues actually written, summed over the output chains. A merge
                does NOT change it: a merged chain contributes all of its
                segments' residues, so 41 + 49 reads as 90 on one chain.
    chains      the chain IDs actually written, comma-joined and in output order
                (AFTER --rename-to or a group's ':<out_id>', so this is what a
                viewer, usalign or ringfit --target-chains will see)
    n_atoms     heavy atoms actually written, summed the same way

Every one of those is "actually written", not "requested": a design whose requested
chain was absent gets an 'error: chain E not in ...' status, an empty path and NA
columns. That is the contract -- a shorter file would be indistinguishable from a
correct one downstream.

NA (empty) rather than 0 marks a field that does not apply: the extraction failed, or
no TSV was written at all. Do not read a blank as "zero chains" -- and do not read a
blank path as "nothing to extract".
