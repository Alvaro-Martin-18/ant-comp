"""
Submit an array (SLURM or Modal) that extracts a named subset of chains from each
design's structure into a new structure file, optionally MERGING several source
chains into one output chain.

Every structure comparison we have is whole-file. ``usalign --mm 1`` on a binder
complex is dominated by the large, fixed target and reads ~1.0 whatever the binder
did; ``--ter 2`` isolates only the FIRST chain, and the binder is the LAST. So a
binder-vs-binder comparison is simply not expressible today. ``chainsel`` makes it
expressible: it writes ``<name>.pdb`` holding only the chains you name, and collects
its path as ``chainsel_path``, which ``usalign --col-a/--col-b`` (with ``--mm 0``)
then consumes like any other structure column.

That splits the two questions a binder campaign must keep apart:

* *did it fold?* -- binder chain of the prediction vs. binder chain of the design,
  each extracted alone, compared with ``--mm 0``;
* *did it stay?* -- the whole complex, compared in the target's frame (that is
  ``usalign --mm 1`` or ``ringfit``, not this tool).

The second reason the tool exists is the SPLIT PROTOMER. A target trimmed of a
membrane belt (SlyB residues 19-59 + 107-155, with a real 13.4 A gap between the
two segments) is handed to a structure predictor as two entities, so the predictor
returns one protomer as TWO chains. ``ringfit`` takes exactly two
``--target-chains`` -- one per protomer -- and cannot be told "t1 is the union of
A and C", so ``bsa_t1``/``bsa_t2``/``bridge_ratio`` are not computable at all on
such a file. ``--merge-groups 'A+C:A,B+D:B'`` writes the same coordinates back as
two chains, and ringfit works again.

Merging is ONLY ever done when asked for explicitly. ``--rename-to`` still REFUSES
to map two kept chains onto one ID, because there it would be an accident; a merge
group says so in the flag itself.

``action: update`` -- an extracted sub-structure is a *property* of a design that
already exists (like a relaxed structure or a metric), not a new entity, so it
annotates the same table in place and mints no child. Run it twice with different
``-l/--dir-label`` to extract two different chain sets onto one table.

``default_input_column`` is the literal string ``"not applicable"`` -- the same
sentinel ``usalign`` uses. There is no honest default here: the tool is equally at
home on ``rfdiffusion3_path``, ``boltz_path`` or ``alphafold3_path``, and picking one
would make the other two fail *silently* (a column that is absent from the frame is a
no-op for ``filter_ready``, so every row would look ready and then read a missing
cell). The sentinel matches no column, and the builder raises a named error at submit
time instead -- so **-i/--input-column is effectively required**.

The chain lettering of a designed complex and of its prediction need not agree;
``--rename-to`` normalises the extracted chain to a fixed letter so the two files are
directly comparable.

NUMBERING (the whole reason a merge can go wrong quietly) -- exactly one of three
regimes, and the output always carries one of them:

* neither flag (default): every residue keeps the source residue number and
  insertion code. Two merged segments each numbered 1..N therefore COLLIDE, and the
  worker refuses that design with an error rather than writing a file whose residue
  numbers repeat (a ``{resnum: residue}`` index downstream would silently drop half
  of it);
* ``--renumber``: each OUTPUT chain is renumbered 1..N in written order, insertion
  codes dropped. A merged ``A+C:A`` comes out 1..90 continuous ACROSS the seam;
* ``--renumber-from 'A:19-59,C:107-155'``: each SOURCE chain's segment is renumbered
  consecutively from its own first number, insertion codes dropped -- so the output
  carries the target's real auth numbering and ``ringfit --resnum-match resnum`` can
  pair it against the reference assembly. The optional ``-<last>`` is checked against
  the residues actually written, so a segment of the wrong length is an error.
